Solve LeetCode problem by scala.

Strongly inspired by https://github.com/Leibnizhu/LeetcodeScala

- Detailed unit testing
- Detailed solutions
- Using multiple paradigms to solve problems, that's to say, imperative and functional either

## Test
Using sbt.
```sbtshell
> testOnly algorithms.medium.string.LongestPalindromeTest

[info] - test0: sample input
[info] - test1: sample input
[info] - test2: sample input
[info] - test3: cbbd
[info] - test4: null string
[info] - test5: one element
[info] - test6: distinct element
[info] Run completed in 660 milliseconds.
[info] Total number of tests run: 7
[info] Suites: completed 1, aborted 0
[info] Tests: succeeded 7, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0
[info] All tests passed.
[success] Total time: 9 s, completed 2019-8-7 18:55:49

```

It's easy to write your own test also.
