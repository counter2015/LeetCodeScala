# Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array

## Problem link
https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/

## Description
Given an array of integers `nums` sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given `target` value.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of *O*(log *n*).

If the target is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

## Example
**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]
```





## Solution

This is a variation of binary search algorithms,

Just implement it.
