## Problem link
https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-inorder-and-postorder-traversal/

## Description
Given inorder and postorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

**Note:**
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.


## Example


For example, given

```
inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
postorder = [9,15,7,20,3]
```

Return the following binary tree:

```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```


## Solution
Just implement it.
