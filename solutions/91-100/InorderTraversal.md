## Problem link
https://leetcode.com/problems/restore-ip-addresses/ 

## Description

Given a binary tree, return the *inorder* traversal of its nodes' values.

**Follow up:** Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

## Example

**Example:**

```
Input: [1,null,2,3]
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3
