## Problem link
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/

## Description
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become  `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).

Find the minimum element.

The array may contain duplicates.

**Note:**

- This is a follow up problem to [Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/).
- Would allow duplicates affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

Input: [1,3,5]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [2,2,2,0,1]
