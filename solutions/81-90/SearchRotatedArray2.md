## Problem link
https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/

## Description
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `[0,0,1,2,2,5,6]` might become `[2,5,6,0,0,1,2]`).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return `true`, otherwise return `false`.


**Follow up:**

- This is a follow up problem to [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/),
 where `nums` may contain duplicates.
- Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

## Example

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: false
```


## Solution


Just implement it.
